# React Tabs

Implement the `App` and `Tabs` components to render and switch between given `tabs`.

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_tabs)

✓ Save the `selectedTab` in the `App` (the first `tab` is selected by default);
✓ Implement the `Tabs` component accepting `tabs` as a prop and displaying a link per each `tab` and the content of the selected tab.
✓ Each link show have a href with a `#tab-id` (see the markup).
✓ Pass the `selectedTabId` as a prop to the `Tabs`, the specified tab should be selected if possible
  (otherwise the first tab is selected).
✓ The `Tabs` should show the content of the selected tab (add an attribute `data-cy="tab-content"` for testing).
✓ The selected tab (`li`) should have `is-active` class.
✓ Pass the `onTabSelected` callback to the `Tabs`, it should be called whenever the user selects another tab.
   (Don't call the callback if the tab was not changed)
✓ The callback should receive the data of the selected tab (an object from the array)
✓. The `App` title (`h1`) should show a text saying `Selected tab is Tab 1` (show the title of the selected tab).
✓ When the user selects another tab the `h1` should be updated accordingly.
✓ The `Tabs` component should be stateless (don't have internal state, only props).
