Of rosy grape-juice take one pint or twain;
Sufis, you say, must not take this or that,
Then go and eat the pebbles off the plain!`,

How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;
How oft hereafter rising look for us
Through this same Garden â€“ and for one in vain!`,

But from the worthless keep your walk remote;
Dare to take poison from a sage's hand,
But from a fool refuse an antidote.`,
